# Energy-aluminum-feedback-model
This repository contains the complete insightmaker model developed for investigating the fundamental feedback dynamics between energy and aluminum on a global, aggregated scale. The preprint (Desing et al.) describing the model in detail can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5974514/v1


The repository contains the following:
- "EnergyAluminumModelv20.InsightMaker" which is the complete insightmaker model file. This model can be uploaded either on www.insightmaker.com or run in the "Simulator.html" file locally in any browser.
- "Simulator.html" can be opened in a browser and the model can be run there.
- "EnergyAluminumModelv20.json" is the same model in .json format, which can be run locally with the Simulations package: https://github.com/scottfr/simulation
- "SI_ParameterList.xlsx" is a list of all parameters used in the different scenario runs included in the models. It also contains the parameter ranges for sensitivity analysis described in the paper.
